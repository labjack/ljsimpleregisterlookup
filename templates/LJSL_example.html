        <p>An analog input converts a voltage level into a digital value that can be stored and processed in a computer. Why would you want to measure voltages? There are a multitude of sensors available which convert things like temperature, pressure, etc. into voltages.  The voltages can then be easily measured by various kinds of hardware, such as a LabJack T7, and then read into a computer.  The computer can then convert the voltage value into it's original type (temperature, pressure, etc) and the value can then be stored in a file, emailed to someone, or used to control something else outside of the computer. The T7 exposes analog inputs through MODBUS registers as demonstrated below.</p>

        First, information about configuration: 
        @registers:AIN#(0:10)_RANGE,AIN#(0:10)_NEGATIVE_CH,AIN#(0:10)_RESOLUTION_INDEX
        </p>

        <p>
        Now, information about reading voltage levels:
        @registers:AIN#(0:10)
        </p>
